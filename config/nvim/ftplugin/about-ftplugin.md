# ftplugin is buffer-local

The naming of these files matters! When Vim sets a buffer's filetype to a value
it then looks for a file in ~/.vim/ftplugin/ that matches. For example: if you
run set filetype=derp Vim will look for ~/.vim/ftplugin/derp.vim. If that file
exists, it will run it.

Vim also supports directories inside ~/.vim/ftplugin/. To continue our example:
set filetype=derp will also make Vim run any and all *.vim files inside
~/.vim/ftplugin/derp/. This lets you split up your plugin's ftplugin files into
logical groups.

Because these files are run every time a buffer's filetype is set they must only
set buffer-local options! If they set options globally they would overwrite them
for all open buffers!
